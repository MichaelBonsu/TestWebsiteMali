        <p>- This is my girlfriend, <em> <strong> Malikiya Titania Thompson </strong> </em> <br> - She was bon on February 11, 2001 <br> - She is 22 years old <br> - She is Jamaican-American,<br> (But between you and me, she is more American than she is Jamaican. Very Caucasian of her LOL) <br> <br> - I have known her since high school- We both went to <em> <strong>Bronx Envision Academy,</strong> </em> but in high school we weren't so close (her loss), so we never pursued anything romantic with each other. <br> (Also, in high school, she was more unhinged than she is now LOL, granted, she was dealing with a lot of emotionally, mentally, and physically-draining matters during that time. She's a trooper for real. A survivor!!! *clap clap clap*) <br> <br> - We reconnected in December of 2022, after she reacted and commented on a couple of my Instagram stories <br> (She claims she did that because she thought I was funny and she wanted to be my "friend". he knows she wanted all this LOL) <br> - We texted and talked on the phone a lot after that: we shared life stories and reminisced about high school moments, and eventually, we started hanging out in person. <br> - For out first hangout, we got frozen yogurt <br> (that was back when she still had her car. Let's have a moment of silence for Betsy, the 2012 Toyota Camry her step-dad used to let her drive) <br> - We officially started dating on January 10, 2023 <br> <br> - She doesn't know I am making this website <br> - I'm not sure if we are going to stay together forever-I hope we do, God willing-but, God forbid, if we ever break up, I hope she still comes back to this website whenever she thinks of me, whether the thought is good or bad. She probably won't, but hey, there's nothing wrong with wishful thinking LOL

      <p> I would've added images of Malikiya after high school, but she doesn't post pictures of herself on her social media any more, and she has deleted almost all pictures of herself on the social media platforms she still uses. </p>
